### 🚀 Hosting and Deployment

This project has been migrated from legacy hosting and is now deployed as a Static Site using **Cloudflare Pages**.

* **Deployment Method:** The site is deployed via a **GitHub connection**. Pushing changes to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a new deployment.
* **Build Command:** None (It is a pure static HTML/CSS site).

### ⚠️ Migration Caveat: Server-Side Functionality

**IMPORTANT:** This site was migrated from an older system that may have used server-side scripting (e.g., PHP) for certain functions.

* The **"Contact" form** and any potential **dynamic population of the "News" section** may have been powered by backend code that will **not** execute on the static Cloudflare Pages platform.
* These broken functions must be replaced with modern **serverless alternatives** (like Cloudflare Pages Functions) or third-party services.
